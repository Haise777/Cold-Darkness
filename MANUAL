> Note that this theme is intended to have a minimal installation process. Read the 'MANUAL' file for more details

This theme is designed to make minimal as possible mess, so that it not strip away your chance to costumize your system to your own
options and likings without filling it with a lot of 'my personal preference bloats', so things like Display Managers, Browsers,
Text Editors, etc WILL NOT be installed, nor messed with by this theme above what Qtile already do by default.


> If you have anything that you wanted, you are encouraged to take a look at the Qtile's config files, as it is more easy than you think

to configure it by yourself.
All the Qtile's config logic is separated to it's own files and there is lot's of comment markings made by me to make your
life easier.
You should find all you need in: '~/.config/qtile/settings/'
    groups  - more know as workspaces
    hooks   - functions to hook on events
    keymaps - setup all your bindings there
    layouts - modes and window settings
    screen  - setup bar and it's individual widgets

> To set the wallpapers list this theme will use, put the images you want to use in the '.local/share/backgrounds/cold-darkness' directory"

Qtile will auto pick a random image at the cold-darkness background directory to display at every login, you can add your owns
and remove the default ones if you choose.
You also can alter this behaviour by changing or completely removing the feh entry in the '.config/qtile/autostart.sh'


> You can change the login resolution by your ways or you can add a command to the '.config/qtile/autostart.sh' script"

The installation process will not change how your display manager deals with resolution, so you must set it up by yourself,
qtile should adapt without problems to your resolution options. Alternatively, you can add a entry to the qtile's autostart script
eg: Adding 'xrandr -s 1920x1080' to the autostart will make so that the resolution is set in the qtile's startup


> You can safely delete this directory or you can keep it and run the 'installation_options' script to reconfigure the theme"

By running the installation_options script, you can retry the theme with it's different installation options
without the need to rerun the installation process


> If you have any suggestions or problems, feel free to leave them at the theme's github page 'https://github.com/Haise777/Cold-Darkness'


> By default you can change the system sound volume by scrolling with the mousewheel on the sound widget

By scrolling the mousewheel in the arrow with a percentage to it's side, you can control your general volume, you
also can mute the sound by clicking on it.


> Change the default colors of the theme

Simply edit the 'colorspallet.py' file found in the '.config/qtile/' directory
